## MoodleBox

This repository is a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) box to build up a Debian server running NGINX (latest), PHP 7, MySQL 5.7, NodeJS 6 and Moodle 3.3.1.

====================
#### Instructions

This box was made in a way that supports Vagrant 1.8.1 or higher. It also requires [VirtualBox 5](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

After cloning this repository on your computer, from inside the vagrant-moodlebox directory, type:
```
vagrant up
```

You can log to this box by using:
```
vagrant ssh
```

The default user is vagrant, and its password is vagrant.

You can access this box with 2 addresses:  
```
http://192.168.1.2 # which points to /home/vagrant/public_html
http://192.168.1.2/moodle # which points to a working Moodle installation
```

**ATTENTION**  
If you run Vagrant on a Unix-like operating system, it's possible that it will ask a password every time you do `vagrant up` or `vagrant halt`.  
This password will be the one from the user that has the right to run sudo commands.  
In case you want Vagrant to never ask for a password again when using the mentioned commands, you must add one line in the sudoers file.  
```
sudo visudo
```

At the end of the file, add this:
```
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTMANAGER_UPDATE = /bin/cp /home/<YOUR_USER>/.vagrant.d/tmp/hosts.local /etc/hosts
%sudo ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_HOSTMANAGER_UPDATE
```

Change <YOUR_USER> for the user that you use on your operating system, that has permission to run sudo commands.
